# Purpose of the application

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

The Flat Easy Finder project uses web scraping techniques to acquire data from real estate advertising portals. This gives users tools for quick and easy analysis of the real estate market. The application provides the ability to search for flats using various criteria, filter results, and sort the results. This provides more flexibility in the search than a real estate portal typically offers.
